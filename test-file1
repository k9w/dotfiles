This is a file I want to add to git, rename it, and remove it from
git, ideally without deleting the file from the working directory.

Looks like removing from git but keeping the file locally in the same
directory is more complicated. So for this example, just rename this
file and remove it from git and from the directory. 

One option to keep the file on disk might be to move it out of the
tracked directory.
