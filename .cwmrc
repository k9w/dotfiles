# CWM uses C-/ to search applications. Emacs and mg use it to undo.
# CWM does not even find open applications with it. And I want to use
# it for Emacs. So the below command unbinds the key for CWM.

# Specifying C-/ did not work here. cwm(1) manpage refers to the
# command as C-slash, which works below. But that was not obvious from
# the manpage.

unbind-key C-slash
