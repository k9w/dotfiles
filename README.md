This 'dotfiles' git repository tracks configuration files in my home
folder on OS installs across most all of my machines. This one is on
the branch 'manjaro-pinebook'.

Do not use: 

```
$ git add .
```

Each time you modify a file you want git to track, whether or not git
already tracks it, use 'git add' on that file or set of files by name.

```
$ git add README.md
```
